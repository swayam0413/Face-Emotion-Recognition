# Facial Emotion Recognition 😃😢😠

A deep learning-based computer vision project that detects and classifies human facial emotions from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning. The model is trained to recognize multiple emotional expressions and analyze facial patterns effectively.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an intelligent facial emotion recognition system that can classify human emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral from facial images. It uses deep learning techniques and computer vision to automatically learn emotional features from facial data.

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of facial images and optimized using data augmentation and fine-tuning to improve accuracy and generalization.
